\title{Convert EQ5D-3L-values stored in combined character vectors to Swedish
EQ5D-index based on TTO}
\usage{
eq5d_3l_index_tto_old(x, split = ",")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{character vector with comma-separated vaslues for each dimension.}

\item{split}{
    character vector (or object which can be coerced to such)
    containing \link[base]{regular expression}(s) (unless \code{fixed = TRUE})
    to use for splitting.  If empty matches occur, in particular if
    \code{split} has length 0, \code{x} is split into single characters.
    If \code{split} has length greater than 1, it is re-cycled along
    \code{x}.
  }
}
\value{
numeric vector with EQ5D-indices based on TTO
}
