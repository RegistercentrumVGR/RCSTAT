\title{Calculate Swedish EQ5D-indices based on TTO}
\usage{
eq5d_index(..., levels, type, old = FALSE, split = ",")
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{arguments passed to underlying methods.
Either `mobility,selfcare,usual,pain,anxiety`
to [eq5d_3l_index_tto()] or [eq5d_5l_index_tto()]
or `x` to [eq5d_3l_index_tto_old()]}

\item{levels}{numeric: 3 or 5 for the number of levels used}

\item{type}{character: "TTO" or "VAS"}

\item{old}{logic: should [eq5d_3l_index_tto_old()] be used?}

\item{split}{
    character vector (or object which can be coerced to such)
    containing \link[base]{regular expression}(s) (unless \code{fixed = TRUE})
    to use for splitting.  If empty matches occur, in particular if
    \code{split} has length 0, \code{x} is split into single characters.
    If \code{split} has length greater than 1, it is re-cycled along
    \code{x}.
  }
}
\value{
numeric vector with calculated indices
}
\description{
The general purpose eq5d-package (available on CRAN) might be used for most
calculations of EQ5D-index values. Some combinations based on Swedish value
sets are, however, not (yet) available there.

\examples{
eq5d_index(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, levels = 3, type = "TTO")
eq5d_index(c("1,1,1,1,1"), levels = 3, type = "TTO", old = TRUE)
eq5d_index(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, levels = 5, type = "TTO")
eq5d_index(3,4,5,4,3, levels = 5, type = "VAS")
